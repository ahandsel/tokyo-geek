### [ ] Mount Kawanori: Enthusiast

* A step up in the hiking stakes introduces Mt. Kawanori, which can be climbed year-round-but be prepared for snow in the winter.
* The hike has some risky bits, so you need to watch your footwork. The first rest station can be reached after about 35 minutes. After a rather precarious path which rises above the river, you arrive at the towering Hyakuhiro Waterfall. From here on, it's an unyielding 100-minute climb to the summit, which makes an excellent spot to roll out the picnic mat and bask in the natural surroundings. On this ascent there are some ropes added for support, and a fork in the road allows you to choose a tougher trail (straight ahead) or a better-maintained trail (to your left) on your way to the summit. Find out more about hiking Mt. Kawanori.
* Nearest station: JR Okutama
  * From there, it's a 15-minute bus ride to the Kawanori-bashi bus stop, where the trail starts.


### [ ] Mount Mitsumine: Enthusiast

* The Saitama side of the Chichibu-Tama-Kai Park is home to Mount Mitsumine and Lake Chichibu, which means superb hiking and beautiful lake views! The course includes breathtaking vistas from suspension bridges, a 2000-year-old shrine, and plenty of mountain huts for hikers and campers.

 full trail takes about 5 hours with time for gazing at views.

* bring your own lunch
* This Mt. Mitsumine guide has a list of all the sites and routes. For more details, see our post on this awesome Tokyo hike.

* Mitsumine-Guchi Station
* => Take a bus from there to the Owa stop.
* On your return, you can take the bus from the lake all the way to the station.


### [x] Mount Mitake: Enthusiast

* A real nature-lover's delight, Mt. Mitake is filled with all the flora and fauna you could ask for, and is the gate to the Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park.
* 4 min Cable Car up the mountain
* There is a cable car, but if you decide to hike, it's about a 60-minute walk from the valley to Mitake Shrine, and then you can walk for another hour or so to reach the beautiful "Rock Garden" - a forest valley with a stream, moss-carpeted rocks and waterfalls.

From there, it's another hour or so to the summit of Mt. Otake, with various hiking trails to other viewpoints and mountains. There is a Visitor Centre between then ropeway and the shrine, with maps for the different trails, but note that it is closed on Mondays. Ready to go? First read more details on hiking Mt. Mitake.
Nearest station: JR Mitake. From there, you can take a bus to Takimoto cable car station (10 minutes, 270 yen), then the cable car (6 minutes, 570 yen one way) about halfway up the mountain.

* Mt. Oyama has an awesome shrine and temple to see, and is also famous for tofu—so you'll see some tofu restaurants on the initial ascent to the ropeway (which is where the trails begin).
* The onna-zaka (women's trail) is shorter than the otoko-zaka (men's trail)
  * The women's trail does pass by "seven wonders"
* Once you reach the Oyama Afuri Shrine, you can follow signs for the Shimosha Trail to the main shrine and summit (although it is closed from Feb-April).
