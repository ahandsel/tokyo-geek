## How to buy Shinkansen tickets

There are three websites that you can use to buy Shinkansen tickets:
* SmartEX - run by JR Central; fully supports English.
* Eki-net.com - run by JR East; partially supports English.
* Klook - a third-party website that sells Shinkansen tickets.

How do these three websites compare?

### Important notes about SmartEX

* SmartEX only supports tickets for the Tokaido, Sanyo, and Kyushu Shinkansen lines.
  * Use either Eki-net or Klook for other Shinkansen lines.
* You cannot use SmartEX with the Japan Rail Pass or other passes.
* When you click `Purchase`, your credit card will be charged.
  * After this point, there is a cancellation fee.
  * Changing the reservation is free.
* Luggage - you must reserve a seat with an oversized baggage area if you have luggage larger than carry-on size. [Details](https://smart-ex.jp/en/entraining/oversized-baggage/)


### Additional notes on using SmartEX

* All dates and times are in Japan Standard Time (JST).
* All prices are in Japanese Yen (JPY).
* If you want a paper ticket, you will need the `pickup code` and account login credentials.
* If your credit card does not support [3-D Secure Authentication](https://smart-ex.jp/en/reservation/reserve_smart/3dsecure/), you will need to enter a security code each time you buy a ticket.
* You cannot mix train classes (regular vs. Green) on the same ticket.
  * Example: You need two tickets if you want to use the Green car (first-class car) on the first train, followed by a reserved car (ordinary car) on the second train.
* You cannot mix train types (express vs. local) on the same ticket.
  * Example: You need two tickets if you want to use the Nozomi on the first train, followed by a Hikari on the second train.
