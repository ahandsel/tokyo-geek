## Internet + Cell Service

_Trying to search for a cell phone plan in Japan?_

Go to a [Yodobashi Camera („É®„Éâ„Éê„Ç∑„Ç´„É°„É©)](https://www.google.com/maps/search/%E3%83%A8%E3%83%89%E3%83%90%E3%82%B7%E3%82%AB%E3%83%A1%E3%83%A9/) or [Bic Camera („Éì„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Ç´„É°„É©)](https://www.google.com/maps/search/%EF%BE%8B%EF%BE%9E%EF%BD%AF%EF%BD%B8%EF%BD%B6%EF%BE%92%EF%BE%97/) store
* These big electronics stores have well-staffed cell phone section where you can browser through various plans
* Stores by major stations also tend to have more English speaking staff

Go to a Yodobashi or Bic Camera staff and ask for a recommendation
* They will go over the various plans and help you pick the best one for your needs & price range
* ‚ö° Do not go to the specific cell phone plan salesperson at the branded booths unless you are 100% sure you want their plans

Personal Recommendation:
* Store: [Yodobashi Camera Shinjuku West Main Store („É®„Éâ„Éê„Ç∑„Ç´„É°„É© Êñ∞ÂÆøË•øÂè£Êú¨Â∫ó)](https://goo.gl/maps/A6AnJRYfraKQURZk6)
* Plan: SoftBank ÂÖâ + YMobile Bundle Plan
  * Great for working at home with the fast Softbank ÂÖâ fiber internet connection
  * Cheaper than buying the two services separately (saved on setup costs and reduced monthly billing)
  * Simple integration with [PayPay](https://blog.paypay.ne.jp/en/english-language-on-paypay/)

As of Nov 2022:
* SoftBank ÂÖâ is pricier but the fastest internet plan for Tokyo
* YMobile is a budget-friendly cell phone plan that has the same coverage as SoftBank
  * Recommend YMobile for those who want coverage in rural areas (mountains, beaches, etc.)
* Rakuten Mobile is the cheapest cell phone plan but has limited coverage


### Payment Methods

* Easiest way to pay for your cell phone plan would be with a credit card
* Japan Post Bank is the way one to open a bank account with.
  * For more information, refer to the [How To Open A Japan Post Bank Account - MATCHA](https://matcha-jp.com/en/4496) article.
* Then apply for a [Rakuten credit card](https://www.rakuten-card.co.jp/) before trying to get a cell phone plan.
* Got money in a different currency? Consider [Wise Debit Card](https://transferwise.prf.hn/l/6Z8d5Y5) as a payment method.


### Notes on Cell Phone Plans in Japan

Japan's major cell service providers:
* AU
* Docomo
* Softbank
* Rakuten Mobile

Data + voice vs data-only plans?
* It is cheaper to get a data-only plan and use a VoIP app like LINE or WhatsApp for voice calls
* Generally, data-only plans does not support phone calls or SMS (text messages)
  * Great for those who have company phones
  * Not great when trying to use 2-step verification for online services (security or sign ups)
