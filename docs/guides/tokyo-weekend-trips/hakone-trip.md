## Great things about Hakone

* 🌳 Scenic mountains, lakes, and many hot springs (onsen) and traditional ryokan inns.
* 🚅 Easy access from Tokyo via Odakyu Romancecar.
* 🖼️ Various attractions: including art museums, hiking trails, and boat cruises.


## Plan ahead

* Limited hours for attractions, restaurants, and shops - mostly 10:00 to 17:00.
* Hilly terrain and limited public transportation options make getting around challenging.
* Limited food options: breakfast and dinner can be hard to find, and lunch options are crowded.
* Can be very crowded on weekends and holidays.
* Long waits and lines at popular attractions, restaurants, and transport during peak times.


## Tips for visiting Hakone

* Start early - attractions and transport get crowded and many close before sunset.
* Plan meals ahead and book where possible.
* Head to [COFFEE CAMP][] before 08:30 for breakfast to avoid long waits.
* Get the paper Hakone Freepass (see below); cellular reception in Hakone is spotty.
* Check hours and availability on official sites or by phone; Google Maps is not always accurate.
* Dress in layers - mountain weather is cooler and changes quickly.
* Check local weather hourly at [Hakone tenki.jp][].

### Paper version of the Hakone Freepass

> [!TIP] ⚡ Get the paper Hakone Freepass at Shinjuku or Odawara station.

* Either buy it directly or swap a Klook voucher for the physical paper pass at Shinjuku station or Odawara station.
* The paper pass is more reliable than the e-ticket because cellular reception in Hakone is spotty and many international carriers perform poorly there.
* Pickup locations:
  * [Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center - Shinjuku West (`小田急旅行センター 新宿西口地下`)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J3uuBYtD8KmEVjnB7)
