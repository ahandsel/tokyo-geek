  * The Tenen Hiking Course connects Kenchoji Temple in Kita-Kamakura with Zuisenji Temple in the east of the city, leading mostly along the ridge of the hills. The whole trail takes about 60-90 minutes to complete, and hikers can find several tomb caves (yagura) along their way. The trail can also be accessed through the Shishimai Valley, which is a popular spot for autumn colors in early December.
