* **Standard seats are narrow** - Smaller than those on JAL or ANA.

## How to get seats with extra legroom

1. **Do not select a package** - All packages require you to choose standard seats.
2. Ideally, select **extra legroom seats in the front section** - A small wall provides privacy and small storage pockets.
3. Look for **extra legroom seats in the center aisle** (not an emergency exit row).
4. If you pick a side aisle, **avoid the window seat** - The wall curves inward, reducing headspace.
5. The **window seat provides a pocket** large enough for an iPad.
