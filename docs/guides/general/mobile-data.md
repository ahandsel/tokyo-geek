## TL;DR - Quick recommendations

Here is my quick recommendation for getting cell phone service while traveling in Japan:


### Traveling solo or as a couple?

* Use the [eSIM method](#esim-method) for data-only service. Consider the [eSIM with voice and data](#esim-with-voice-and-data) if you plan on making calls. However, you do not need reservations if you are just one or two people.


### Traveling for work?

* Use the [mobile router method](#mobile-router-method) for fast, reliable internet.
* While global shops like Starbucks or McDonald's offer free Wi-Fi, many cafes and train stations do not. (Free Wi-Fi is not as common in Japan as in the United States.)
* Another option is to use the [eSIM method](#esim-method) and find [co-working spaces](https://tokyocheapo.com/business/drop-in-coworking-spaces-tokyo/) when you need to work.


### Traveling as a group?

* Have one person use the [eSIM with voice and data](#esim-with-voice-and-data) for a Japanese phone number. This person can make reservations and sign up for services.
* Everyone else can use the [eSIM method](#esim-method) for data-only service.
* For those on travel-friendly carriers like T-Mobile, use the [carrier method](#carrier-method).


## Overview

There are three options for getting mobile data when traveling in Japan:
1. [eSIM method](#esim-method) - Buy an eSIM card from travel eSIM providers.
2. [Mobile router method](#mobile-router-method) - Rent a mobile router.
3. [Carrier method](#carrier-method) - Enable your cell service provider's international roaming services.

Who should use the **eSIM** method?
* Those with an unlocked phone that is not limited by the cell service provider.
* Those with a phone that supports eSIM (iPhone 11 and newer models).

Who should use the **mobile router** method?
* Those using an older phone that does not support eSIM.
* Those with a phone locked by the cell carrier.
* Those needing to connect multiple devices to Wi-Fi.
* Those needing to download and upload large files from a computer.

Who should use the **carrier** method?
* Those whose cell service provider offers free or affordable international roaming services.


## eSIM method


### What is an eSIM?

* An eSIM is a virtual SIM card that can be used on a smartphone.
* It allows you to use mobile cellular services without a physical SIM card.
* Unlike physical SIM cards, eSIM cards can be downloaded from the provider's app.


### Which iPhone models support eSIM?

* All iPhones released after 2019 support eSIM (iPhone 11 and newer models).
* Examples: iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, and newer models.
* For more information, refer to the [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209044) page.


### How to use eSIM

1. Research and purchase an eSIM card from providers (options listed below).
2. Install the eSIM provider's app.
3. Purchase a data plan.
4. Install the eSIM card.
5. Enable the data roaming setting before flying.
6. Mobile data is now available.
7. Disable the data roaming setting when returning.

### eSIM with voice and data

For those who want a Japanese cell phone number during their stay, consider the [Short Term Voice+Data eSIMs from Mobal](https://www.mobal.com/japan-esims/?t=st#:~:text=Short%20Term%20Voice%2BData%20eSIMs).

While it is more expensive than data-only eSIMs, it allows you to make and receive calls in Japan like a local.

It is great for making reservations and signing up for Japanese apps and services.


## Mobile router method

Also known as Pocket Wi-Fi, mobile routers are portable Wi-Fi routers that you can rent during your trip.
* Mobile routers are useful if you have multiple devices to connect and need fast, reliable internet.
* However, it is annoying having to charge and carry an additional device.

Tip: Carry it in your backpack with a power bank to keep it charged. Most mobile routers last only a few hours on a single charge.


### Options and pricing

* Check out Tokyo Cheapo's [Renting a Pocket Wi-Fi Router in Japan](https://tokyocheapo.com/business/internet/rent-wifi-router-japan/) article for a list of options and prices.


## Carrier method

See if your cell service provider offers international roaming services.
* For example, T-Mobile offers free international data roaming in Japan.


Pros
* The simplest option - likely only requires enabling and disabling the data roaming setting from your cell service provider's app.

Cons
* Expensive - Additional charges may be costly, so check the rates before using it.
* Limited data - Most carriers impose a data cap for international roaming.
