## Tips

* Compare Uber and Lyft prices before booking a ride. Often, one is cheaper than the other.
* Revolut and Wise are both great for managing multiple currencies.
  * They also support peer-to-peer payments, which is useful for splitting bills with friends.
  * Revolut is more user-friendly, while Wise has a better exchange rate.
