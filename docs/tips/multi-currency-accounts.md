## What they are

**Wise** and **Revolut** are fintech platforms that offer multi-currency accounts, low-cost foreign exchange, and debit cards you can use internationally. They are popular with travelers who want to hold multiple currencies and spend abroad without the high exchange markups typical of traditional banks. The short version: you can keep balances in multiple currencies, convert when rates are favorable, and pay in the local currency using a card or mobile wallet.

If you are deciding between them, remember what I noted in other tips: Wise and Revolut overlap in core features but differ in supported currencies, pricing details, and regional availability. Using both can add flexibility if one app has limits or downtime.


## Why they are useful for travel

When you travel, banks often charge foreign transaction fees or hide exchange costs in the rate they give you. Multi-currency accounts help you avoid that by letting you:

* **Hold multiple currencies** before you fly so you are not forced to exchange at the airport.
* **Convert at competitive rates** inside the app and lock in rates when they are favorable.
* **Pay like a local** using a debit card in the destination currency.
* **Access cash abroad** via ATMs (watch for local ATM fees).
* **Manage travel budgets** by keeping a specific currency balance for each trip.

This is especially helpful for frequent travelers, digital nomads, or anyone moving between countries and needing a simple way to spend and transfer money internationally.


## Wise vs. Revolut (quick comparison)

Both services are strong options, but they are not identical. Based on common usage and my experience documenting them elsewhere in this repo:

* **Wise**
  * Strong coverage for international transfers and local bank details.
  * Often the go-to choice for moving money between countries.
  * Widely recommended for transparent fees on exchange.
* **Revolut**
  * Great for everyday spending and travel budgeting.
  * Often provides very competitive exchange rates within plan limits.
  * Adds features like savings vaults and extra card options.

If you only want one, pick the one that best matches your travel pattern. If you travel frequently, using both can help with redundancy and give you the best rate/feature mix.


## How to set them up (step-by-step)

You can set up Wise and Revolut in roughly the same way. The flow below works for most regions, but the exact screens may vary.

1. **Download the app**
   * [Wise][wise-app]
   * [Revolut][revolut-app]
2. **Create your account**
   * Use your legal name and current address.
   * Expect to provide proof of identity (passport or ID).
3. **Verify your identity**
   * Both services require identity checks to comply with financial regulations.
   * Follow the in-app steps to upload ID and take a selfie.
4. **Add money**
   * Link a bank account or card and add funds in your home currency.
   * Bank transfers are usually the cheapest funding method.
5. **Create or add currency balances**
   * Add the currencies you plan to use (USD, JPY, EUR, etc.).
   * Convert a small test amount to verify the process.
6. **Order a card**
   * Physical cards are handy for cash withdrawals and chip-and-PIN payments.
   * Add the card to Apple Pay or Google Pay for tap-to-pay.
7. **Set alerts and limits**
   * Set rate alerts so you can convert when the exchange rate hits your target.
   * Review spending limits, ATM limits, and any plan restrictions.


## Travel tips for using multi-currency accounts

* **Convert before you arrive** when rates are favorable (avoid airport kiosks).
* **Use local currency balances** when paying in-store or online to avoid dynamic currency conversion fees.
* **Keep a backup card** in case one card is declined or the app has a service outage.
* **Check weekend/after-hours rates** — some services charge a markup outside market hours.
