While Figma is not the ideal tool for writing, it is now the industry standard for design. Here are some Figma plugins that are helpful for UX writers.

## Examples and best practices


### Find and replace layer names

The [Find and Replace Layer Names][] plugin allows you to quickly find and replace layer names in your Figma file. It is especially useful when you need to update multiple layer names at once. For example, if you have a design system with consistent naming conventions, this plugin can help you maintain consistency across your files.


### Select layers

The [Select Layers][] plugin enables you to select layers based on various criteria such as name, type, or similarity. This can be particularly helpful when you need to make bulk changes to specific types of layers. For instance, you can select all text layers and apply a new font style to them.


### Phrase Strings

The [Phrase Strings][] plugin allows you to pull and push UX copy between Phrase Strings and Figma. This is useful for ensuring that your designs are always up to date with the latest copy. By tying the copy to layer names, you can easily update the text in your designs without manually copying and pasting.

The plugin works well if you have all the relevant text layers named correctly and only have to work with a few layers.  
It starts to freeze or crash Figma if you have a lot of text layers, so be careful about that.


### Change text

The [Change Text][] plugin allows you to bulk edit the text contents of multiple layers, groups, and frames. This can save you a lot of time when you need to make changes to large amounts of text. For example, if you need to update the wording of a button across multiple screens, this plugin can help you do it quickly and efficiently.


### Rename It

The [Rename It][] plugin allows you to batch rename layers and frames. This is useful for keeping your Figma files organized and maintaining a consistent naming convention. For example, you can use this plugin to add prefixes or suffixes to layer names, or to replace specific words in layer names.


### Reset text layer name

The [Reset Text Layer Name][] plugin allows you to reset the name of a text layer to match its content. This can be helpful for keeping your layers organized and making it easier to find specific text layers in your Figma file. For example, if you have a text layer with the content "Submit", this plugin will rename the layer to "Submit".
