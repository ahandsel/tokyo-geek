ZIPAIR Notes

  


How to select the best seat with the Extra legroom

  1. Do not select a package (all packages force you to select the standard seats)
  2. Ideally, select the Extra legroom seats in the front section (a small wall provides privacy & small pockets)
  3. Look for the Extra legroom in the Center Aisle (not an emergency exit)
  4. If you pick a side aisle, don't pick the window seat; the wall curves make the headspace smaller
  5. The window seat does provide a pocket big enough for an iPad
