# ZIPAIR Notes

Quick tips on using the ZipAir airline.

## How to Select the Best Seat with Extra Legroom

1. **Do not select a package** – All packages force you to select standard seats.
2. Ideally, select **Extra Legroom seats in the front section** – A small wall provides privacy & small pockets.
3. Look for **Extra Legroom seats in the center aisle** (not an emergency exit).
4. If you pick a side aisle, **avoid the window seat** – The wall curves make the headspace smaller.
5. The **window seat provides a pocket** big enough for an iPad.

## Ordering an Inflight Meal

- **Taste** – All meals are tasty.
- **Size** – Small; consider ordering two for a long flight.
- You can always **bring food onboard** (Narita has a 7-11 near the ZIPAIR terminal).
- **Order 3 hours before the flight**.
- The number of meals and selections is limited when purchasing during the flight**.
- **Option to get the meal 2 hours before arrival** (with a small charge).
