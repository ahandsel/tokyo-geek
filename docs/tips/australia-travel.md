## Preparations

Mobile data: Optus prepaid eSIM or SIM

* [Optus prepaid eSIM](https://www.optus.com.au/prepaid/sim-plans) are by far the cheapest with best coverage in Australia.
* Get the eSIM online and install it before arriving in Australia.
* For physical SIM, buy at convenience stores or supermarkets like Woolworths. Same plans as eSIM.
* I got the 65GB for $13 AUD trial plan, which is valid for 28 days. Then I ended the plan to prevent auto-renewal.

Power plug: Type I

* Australia uses [Type I plugs](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Australasian_AS/NZS_3112_and_compatible_plugs_(Type_I)>).
* [Anker Nano Travel 5-Port Power Adapter](https://a.co/d/bv6FRql)
