Here are a few things that made my trip between Paris, Amsterdam, and Brussels easier and more enjoyable. Hopefully, they will help you too.


## Summary

* **Travel light** - Avoid suitcases; use backpacks and duffel bags.
* **eSIMs are a must** - Public Wi-Fi is not common, and Nomad's Europe plan worked well.
* **Eurostar takes time** - Expect delays and limited luggage space.
* **Urban smells are real** - Pack alcohol wipes and masks for unpleasant odors.
* **Apple Pay is everywhere** - Nearly all shops accept credit cards; just watch for foreign transaction fees.
* **Photocopy ID** - Keep a paper copy of your passport and ID in your day-pack to avoid loss or theft.


## Packing and luggage tips

* European cities are **not designed for suitcases** - cobblestones, narrow streets, and stairs are common.
* Use **large backpacks instead of wheeled suitcases** - easier to carry and better suited for cobbled streets and narrow hotel staircases.
* **Every zipper should be lockable** - pickpocketing is common in high-traffic areas.
* For my partner and me, we packed:
  * 2 large backpacks (one for each of us)
  * 1 medium-sized day-pack packed inside one of the large backpacks
  * 1 sling or under-clothing money wallet
  * 1 duffel bag reserved for souvenirs and extra items for the return trip
* Pack a **foldable duffel bag** to carry souvenirs or extra items for the return trip.
* Bring **thin slippers** for hotel rooms - shoes are commonly worn indoors in Europe.

Specific bags used:

* [tomtoc 40 L travel backpack](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B097QWFJRX) - Tough and durable, with a laptop compartment. Good choice for more delicate items.
* [Foldable Boston bag 65 L](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09L43MKDS) - Cheap but durable duffel bag.
* [Solo Tourist HT-BP41 backpack](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B001LGVW9K) - A simple backpack with foldable straps that can be checked as luggage.
* [Waterproof helmet bag](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0C858T85X) - A great day-pack since it is waterproof, lightweight, has a large opening, and only 2 zippers.


## Eurostar travel tips

* **Expect delays** - Eurostar trains are frequently behind schedule. Do not rely on them for tight connections, and do not schedule anything important immediately after.
* **Overhead luggage storage** - You must lift your luggage overhead to store it, like a carry-on bag on an airline.
* **No checked luggage service** - Everything goes in the overhead racks.
* **Limited elevators and escalators** - Access to the train platforms can be challenging. Nearly all have at least one elevator, but they are difficult to find. Stairs are the default.
* **Train car numbers are often out of order** - When trains are attached or detached, the car numbers may change. Be ready to change your location quickly.
* **Ticket prices fluctuate** - Midday departures often have the highest prices.
* **Book in advance** - The reservation process takes time and is not always intuitive.
* **Slow Wi-Fi** - Onboard Wi-Fi is free but very slow. eSIMs are a better option.
* **Electric outlets next to seats** - Most seats have electric outlets, but they are not always in the best location. Bring a **light charger** for Eurostar or airline power outlets.


## Mobile data and eSIM

* Recommended mobile data amounts:
  * 7-day trip: **10 GB**
  * 14-day trip: **20 GB**
* eSIM providers (in order of recommendation):
  1. **Nomad** - [Nomad Europe eSIM](https://www.getnomad.app/europe-eSIM)
     * 25% off using `KEITLQPQFA` referral code - [help doc](https://www.getnomad.app/help-center/articles/9886364)
  2. **Airalo** - [Airalo Europe eSIM](https://www.airalo.com/europe-eSIM)
     * [Use code `AB6826` to get $3.00 off your first order](https://ref.airalo.com/DB2m)
* The **Nomad eSIM plan** was reliable throughout Europe.
* Use a **VPN set to the UK** for easier website access - many sites default to the local language and layout.


## Currency and payments

* **Credit cards are accepted nearly everywhere** - even for small purchases.
* Watch out for **foreign transaction fees** - they add up on transit or small charges.
* **Apple Card** worked well: instant notifications and clear currency conversions.
* **[Revolut][]** is highly recommended - set it up before your trip.
* Withdraw **about €50 in cash** in small bills (€1, €2, €5) for tipping or cash-only toilet locations.

## Environment and hygiene

* The **smell of urine, cigarettes, and marijuana is common** in urban areas.
  * Wash clothes more often than expected - choose hotels or Airbnbs with laundry facilities.
* Bring:
  * **Detergent** (travel-size)
  * **Alcohol wipes** - for hands and surfaces
  * **Face masks**, especially for Eurostar train restrooms


## Tech and device tips

* Leave the laptop - bring an **iPad with a small keyboard** instead.
  * Easier to use in landscape mode than a phone
  * Less anxiety about theft
* **Bring a phone strap** - drop protection for crowded areas.
* **Water bottle with filter built-in** like [Brita Filtering Water Bottle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H17RM1B/) is great for filling up at sinks.
* **Extra power bank** - outlets can be rare in cafes, trains, or stations.
* Attach **AirTags** to every bag and important item.
* Bring an extra AirTag for your Airbnb keys.
* **Battery life is crucial** - bring an extra-large power bank.
* **Lightweight power adapter** - the [Sanwa Supply TR-AD4W overseas power conversion adapter](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B075CXDNW2) worked well for us.


## Using AI for translations

* **Google Translate** is great for quick translations that can be done offline.
  * Make sure to download the language packs for offline use.
* **ChatGPT** and other AI tools can provide translation plus context, allowing for more helpful understanding.
