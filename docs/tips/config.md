## Conference prep

Here are some tips to help you get the most out of the Config conference.


### Find and join events ahead of time

* Search and sign up for events before the conference to connect with attendees and network.
* Look for events on platforms such as:
  * [Luma](https://lu.ma/discover)
    * [San Francisco events](https://lu.ma/sf)
    * [ADPList Â· Events Calendar](https://lu.ma/adplistcommunity?k=c)
    * [Config 2024 Community Events Â· Events Calendar](https://lu.ma/config2024)
  * Config's [Community Events](https://config.figma.com/community-events)
  * [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/)
  * [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)
* Search on Google with "Config Kickoff Happy Hour" or "Config After Party" queries.
* Check for lists provided by the conference organizers.
  * Example: [Config 2024 After Party and Meetups List](https://johnrodrigues.substack.com/p/config-2024-after-party-and-meetups)
* Conference sponsors often host events, so look for those as well.
  * Example: [GitHub x Figma Dev Community Event](https://githubday0.splashthat.com/), where they showcased their product and how it integrates with Figma.
* Figma competitors also host events, so look for those as well.
  * Example: [Config Meetup by Wix Studio](https://www.postconfigparty.com/)
  * Besides networking, they demonstrated their product and how it compares with Figma.


### Join the Slack workspace and reach out

* Join the Slack workspace for the conference to connect with other attendees.
* This is how we met other UX writers and designers during the conference.
* UX writers are rare in the wild. ðŸ˜…


## During the conference


### Coffee spots

Grab coffee before heading to the conference. Here are some spots I recommend:
* [Bean Bar Cafe](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VA3MK2GYsk35F2Ue6) - best coffee in my opinion.
* [SFMOMA Steps Coffee](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cPANQ3ehjReRufd9)
* [Starbucks - 789 Mission St](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B3382mHnn7myBab38) - mobile ordering is your friend here.


### Day 0 events are fun and worth attending

* Grab your badge early to avoid the lines.
* Attend the kickoff happy hour to meet other attendees.


### Play the live stream in the background

* It is easier to grab screenshots and take notes this way.
