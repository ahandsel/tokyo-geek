## Pick a 20-hour layover over a 5-hour layover

* With 20 hours, we could leave the airport, sleep in a bed, and visit 1 attraction.
* You cannot leave the airport if your layover is under 8 hours.
* Beijing Capital International Airport is basic, so a 5-8-hour layover would be boring.


## Air China

* Book directly through Air China.
* We booked a round trip via Booking.com. It led to check-in issues when the aircraft changed and seats were no longer available.
* Air China was a decent, full-service airline.
* Food surprisingly good, and the flight attendants were friendly.
* The seats were old but decent.
* Create an Air China account for each passenger before booking to avoid issues.
* Download the Air China app for easy check-in and boarding pass access.


### Air China transit hotel

* Air China offers free transit hotels for layovers over 8 hours.
* We stayed at the Beijing Airport Lanwan International Hotel.
  * Name in Chinese: `北京空港蓝湾国际酒店`
  * Address: 22 Tianzhu East Road, Shunyi District, Beijing, China
  * Address in Chinese: `天竺地区天柱东路22号, 首都国际机场及新国际会展, 北京, 中国, 101312`
  * Google Maps: [Beijing Lanwan International Airport Hotel Tower A][map-lanwan-hotel]
  * Hotel phone: `(0086) 10-64568436`
* The room was basic. The shower pressure was weak, but the room was clean.
* The room was quiet enough to sleep well. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper.
* The hotel is close to the airport, but it is far from the city and tourist attractions.
* It is great if you want to rest and do not plan to explore the city.
* Next time, we will book a city hotel to explore downtown Beijing.
* A fancy Western-style shopping center is nearby, but there is not much else.

### How to book the transit hotel

* After booking your Air China flight, book the transit hotel through the Air China website or app.
* Details: [Air China transit accommodation][air-china-transit]
* Upon arrival, head directly to the Air China Transfer Service Counter in Terminal 3 (T3) for hotel arrangements.
* If the counter is closed, contact the transit hotel directly or call Air China customer service at 95583 for assistance.
* You can only book single rooms. If you are traveling with a partner, book 2 single rooms. We ended up with a double room on arrival.

## Alipay and WeChat Pay - Chinese QR code payment apps

Tourists can use Alipay and WeChat Pay in China.

* Register accounts in advance and verify your identity using your passport.
* Payments are made via QR codes and linked to your foreign credit cards ([Wise][] credit card worked seamlessly for us).
* Both Alipay and WeChat Pay accept the same phone number.
* A phone number is not required if you completed identity verification in advance, but it is recommended to use a number with Wi-Fi Calling enabled to receive SMS verification codes in China.
