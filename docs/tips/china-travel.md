# Tips for a long layover in Beijing

Here are my notes after doing a 20-hour layover in Beijing International Airport. I hope they will help you too!

[[toc]]


## Summary

**Tech & Apps**
* Set up WeChat Pay and AliPay ahead of time (passport verification required).
* Get an Nomad eSIM
  * 10GB sufficient for two people during a 20-hour stay.
  * Google Maps and Instagram worked fine on the Nomad eSIM.
* Chinese public Wi-Fi blocks many sites.
  * iMessage and Apple Mail (hide my email) work; Gmail does not.
  * NordVPN and ClearVPN do not work on Chinese Wi-Fi.
* DiDi taxi riders were cheap, quick, and reliable.
  * Make sure download the Chinese version - [DiDi: Ride Hailing in China](https://apps.apple.com/app/id554499054)
* Download Chinese maps (e.g., Baidu Maps) for offline navigation.

**Airport and Transit:**
* Beijing International Airport has limited amenities after security
  * Better food choices before security.
  * Pricey and limited shopping and food options after security.
* Arrive at the airport 2 hours before your flight.
* Avoid layovers under 8 hours since you cannot leave the airport.
* Air China offers free basic but clean transit hotels for layovers over 8 hours.
* Luggage checks are strict; remove all batteries from your luggage.

**Communication and Convenience:**
* eSIM essential; make sure to buy and install it before arriving in China.
* iMessage and Apple Mail (hide my email) work on Chinese Wi-Fi; Gmail does not.
* Carry photocopies of passport and ID for security.
* No need for cash; use WeChat Pay or AliPay everywhere.

**General Notes:**
* Smokers are common in public areas - masks are recommended to avoid secondhand smoke.
* Prepare for squat toilets.


## Pick 20 hours layover over just 5 hours

* With 20 hours, we could get out of the airport, sleep on a bed, and visit one attraction.
* You cannot leave the airport if you have a layover of less than 8 hours.
* The Beijing airport was surprisingly basic so a 5 ~ 8 hour layover would be boring.


## Air China

* Recommend booking directly through Air China.
* We booked a round trip via Booking.com which led to check-in issues as the plane changed and seats were no longer available.
* Air China was decent, full service airline.
* Good was surprisingly good, and the flight attendants were friendly.
* Seats were old but decent.
* Create an Air China account per passenger before booking to avoid issues.
* Download the Air China app for easy check-in and boarding pass access.


### Air China transit hotel

* Air China offers free transit hotels for layovers exceeding 8 hours.
* We stayed at the Beijing Airport Lanwan International Hotel
  * Name in Chinese: `北京空港蓝湾国际酒店`
  * Address: 22 Tianzhu East Road, Shunyi District, Beijing, China
  * Address in Chinese: `天竺地区天柱东路22号, 首都国际机场及新国际会展, 北京, 中国, 101312`
  * Google maps: [Beijing Lanwan International Airport Hotel Tower A](https://maps.app.goo.gl/W1DdYHRQHNEchZnJ6)
  * Hotel phone: `(0086) 10-64568436`
* Basic accommodation, the shower was weak but room was clean.
* The room was quiet enough to sleep well. Bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.
* The hotel is located close to the airport, but far from the city and tourist attractions.
* Great if you want to only rest and not explore the city.
* Next time, we will book a city hotel to explore downtown Beijing.
* A fancy Western-style shopping center is nearby, but not much else.

### How to book the transit hotel

* After booking your Air China flight, book the transit hotel through the Air China website or app.
* Details: [Air China Transit Accommodation](https://m.airchina.com/c/invoke/zzjdinstruction@pgenus)
* Upon arrival, head directly to the Air China Transfer Service Counter in Terminal 3 (T3) for hotel arrangements.
* If the counter is closed, contact the transit hotel directly or call Air China's hotline at 95583 for assistance.
* You can only book single rooms. If you are traveling with a partner, you should book 2x single rooms. We ended up getting a double room assigned to us upon arrival.


## AliPay and WeChat Pay - Chinese QR code payment apps

Tourists can use AliPay and WeChat Pay in China:
* Register accounts in advance and verify your identity using your passport.
* Payments are made via QR code, linked to your foreign credit cards ([Wise](https://wise.com/invite/ihpc/genjif1) credit card worked seamlessly for us).
* Both AliPay and WeChat Pay accept the same phone number
* Not required if you completed the identity verification process in advance but it is recommended to use a phone number that has Wi-Fi Calling enabled to receive SMS verification codes while in China.

For detailed setup instructions:

## Visa requirements

*As of 2025-05-23*

Travelers from countries like Japan and Australia qualify for China's unilateral visa-free entry program. Verify your eligibility beforehand to avoid surprises.

## eSIM for internet access

* Ensure you buy and install your eSIM before arriving in China.
* You cannot buy an eSIM locally in China.
* Nomad's China plan provided reliable access, including blocked sites like Google and Instagram.

### If you have to use Chinese Public Wi-Fi

* Famously, China blocks Google, Facebook, Instagram, and other popular sites.
* iCloud email and iMessage work on Chinese Wi-Fi, but Gmail does not.
* NordVPN and ClearVPN do not work on Chinese Wi-Fi.


## Layover logistics


### Arrival procedures at Beijing Capital Airport

2. Complete fingerprint scanning at designated machines.
3. Checked baggage will continue to your final destination.

> [!CAUTION]
> Make sure you pack everything you need during your layover in your carry-on bag. Your checked luggage will go directly to your final destination.


### Leaving the airport

* Use the provided shuttle bus service to reach your transit hotel.


## Forbidden City

* Tickets go on sale one week in advance and require passport verification.
* Arrive early (8:00 am recommended) to avoid significant crowds.
* Book tickets ahead as they can be difficult to secure.
