## AirChina Transit Hotel

* If you have over 8 hours layover, you can book a free transit hotel through Air China.
* Location is close to the airport but far from any tourist attractions.
* Great if you just want to visit a local shopping center and back to the hotel.
* If you want to visit the city, you need to book a hotel in the city.
* The hotel is not a 5-star hotel, but it is clean and comfortable.
* We stayed at the Beijing Airport Lanwan International Hotel.

Upon arrival, go to the Air China Transfer Service Counter
