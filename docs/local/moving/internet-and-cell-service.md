Trying to find a cell phone plan in Japan?

Go to a [Yodobashi Camera (ヨドバシカメラ)][yodobashi-camera] or [Bic Camera (ビックカメラ)][bic-camera] store.

* These big electronics stores have well-staffed cell phone sections where you can compare plans.
* Stores near major stations also tend to have more English-speaking staff.

Talk with staff at Yodobashi or Bic Camera and ask for a recommendation.

* They will review available plans and help you pick the best one for your needs and budget.
* Avoid the branded booths unless you are certain you want their plan.

Personal recommendation:

* Store: [Yodobashi Camera Shinjuku West Main Store (ヨドバシカメラ 新宿西口本店)][yodobashi-shinjuku-west]
* Plan: SoftBank 光 + YMobile bundle plan
  * Reliable for working at home with the fast SoftBank 光 fiber internet connection.
  * Cheaper than buying the two services separately because of lower setup costs and reduced monthly billing.
  * Simple integration with [PayPay][paypay-english].

As of November 2025:

* SoftBank 光 is pricier but the fastest internet plan for Tokyo.
* YMobile is a budget-friendly cell phone plan with the same coverage as SoftBank.
  * YMobile works well for coverage in rural areas (mountains, beaches, and other remote areas).
* Rakuten Mobile is the cheapest cell phone plan but has limited coverage.

* Apply for a [Rakuten credit card][rakuten-credit-card] before trying to get a cell phone plan.

## Notes on cell phone plans in Japan

Japan's major cell service providers:

* AU
* Docomo
* SoftBank
* Rakuten Mobile


### Data + voice vs data-only plans

* It is cheaper to get a data-only plan and use a VoIP app like LINE or WhatsApp for voice calls.
* Generally, data-only plans do not support phone calls or SMS (text messages).
  * Suitable for those who have company phones.
  * Not ideal when trying to use two-step verification for online services (security or sign-ups).

Vocabulary:

* Unlimited plans = `無制限`
