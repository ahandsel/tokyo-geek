## Mercari - Japanese eBay

[Mercari][mercari] (`メルカリ`) is a popular Japanese app for buying and selling used items. It functions similarly to eBay.
* Instead of meeting in person, items are shipped via Japan Post or Yamato Transport.
* Website UX can be translated to Japanese via [user settings][mercari-lang-settings] but the user-generated content is all in Japanese.
* Instead of their app, use the website version to use browser translation features.
* For Japanese listings, you need to use the Japanese version of the App, NOT the US version.

## Facebook groups for buying used items

Join groups like "Sayonara Sales Tokyo" and "Tokyo Used Goods Buy and Sell" to find affordable second-hand furniture and appliances.

Sayonara (`さよなら`) means "goodbye" in Japanese and Sayonara Sales is slang for selling items when leaving Japan.

Many expatriates sell items when they leave Japan, so you can often find good deals on quality products.


## Recycle shops

Recycle shops (`リサイクルショップ`) are physical stores that buy and sell used items.

Search terms to help you find them:
* `リサイクルショップ` = "recycle shop"
* `中古家具` = "used furniture"
* `中古家電` = "used appliances"
* `中古品` = "used goods"

Popular chains:
* Treasure Factory (`トレジャーファクトリー`) = Larger locations in the suburbs offer a wide variety of used furniture, appliances, electronics, and more. Inner-city locations are smaller and limited to clothing.
* Hard Off (`ハードオフ`) = Specializes in used electronics, appliances, musical instruments, and audio equipment. Often located near Book Off stores.
* Book Off (`ブックオフ`) = Primarily sells used books, manga, DVDs, and video games, but some locations also carry used electronics and appliances.
* Off House (`オフハウス`) = Focuses on used household items, furniture, and clothing.

Tips for shopping at recycle shops:
* Keep the receipt so you can reference it when reselling the item later.
* Some shops offer free delivery when purchasing multiple items.
* Some shops accept old items because general waste disposal in Japan can be costly.
