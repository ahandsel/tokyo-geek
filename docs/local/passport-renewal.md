### Preparing for photo and signature capture

* Prepare your facial photograph, signature image, and application information.

Step 2: Application

* Access the [My Number Card portal][my-number-card-portal] and start the passport renewal application.
* Submit your application using the information prepared in advance.

Step 3: Confirmation of application status

* After you submit your application, you can check the subsequent procedures and the status of your application in the To-do list.

## Confirm your digital certificate for signatures

A valid digital certificate for signatures and a password (6 to 16 alphanumeric characters) are required.

Please confirm that your digital certificate for signatures is valid.

* The certificate expires on the fifth birthday after it is issued.
* Please refer to the "Certificate expiration date" printed on your Individual Number Card, or the Public Individual Authentication Service portal site.

## Wait for processing

> [!WARNING] Status will remain 'In process' (`処理中`) until you pick up your passport

* After submitting your application, wait for the processing to be handled by the passport office.
* Once the passport office has finished reviewing your application, you will receive a notification to pick up your passport.
  * The status of your passport application remains 'In process' until you pick it up at the designated passport office, even after processing is complete.
  * While visually the notification may appear to have not changed, the content will slightly differ to indicate that your passport is ready for pickup. (Yes, it is bad UX.)
* Check whether the status content (seen by clicking on the 'In process' status in the To-do list) indicates that your passport is ready for pickup.
