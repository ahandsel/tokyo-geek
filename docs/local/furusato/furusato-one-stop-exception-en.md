## Introduction to the Hometown Tax One-Stop Special Exception System & Special Application Form


## What is the One-Stop Special Exception System?

The One-Stop Special Exception System is a convenient mechanism that allows you to claim deductions for your Hometown Tax donations without filing a tax return.  
You can use this system if you donate to five or fewer municipalities within a year.  
Ordinarily, claiming donation deductions through the Hometown Tax program would require a tax return, but salaried employees who undergo year-end adjustments can still receive the deduction by utilizing the One-Stop Special Exception System.  
To use the One-Stop Special Exception System, you must submit the required documents, including an application form, to each municipality you donated to within the specified application period. Once applied, the deduction will be automatically reflected in the residential tax from June of the following year, with no income tax deduction.

### Benefits of the One-Stop Special Exception System

1. **No need for a tax return to receive donation deductions**  
   Salaried employees who undergo year-end adjustments can receive donation deductions without filing a tax return.

2. **Simple procedure**  
   Complete the process by mailing the required documents to each municipality you donated to.


### Eligibility Requirements for the One-Stop Special Exception System

The One-Stop Special Exception System is available if the following conditions are met:

1. The applicant is a salaried worker who does not need to file an income or residential tax return.
2. No other income or residential tax filings are required besides the Hometown Tax donation.
3. Donations were made to five or fewer municipalities within the year.

In simpler terms, this system is available to those with no other tax filings outside of Hometown Tax donations. Most salaried employees will qualify without issue.  
* **Note:** Even if you donate more than five times, as long as the donations are made to five or fewer municipalities, you can use the One-Stop Special Exception System.

* **Based on regulations as of August 17, 2022; changes may occur due to future revisions.**
* **Charitable donations made through organizations (e.g., the Japanese Red Cross Society) are not eligible for the One-Stop Special Exception System and require a tax return to claim deductions as a Hometown Tax.**
* **Those filing a tax return cannot use the One-Stop Special Exception System.**


#### ⚠️ Important Points for the One-Stop Special Exception System

* Only applicable to residential tax deductions  
  * **Note:** When not exceeding the deduction limit for income tax, there is generally no difference in the total deduction between the One-Stop Special Exception System and tax returns.
* A separate One-Stop Special Application Form is required for each donation made  
* Be mindful of the deadline for submitting the "One-Stop Special Application for Deduction of Donations"  
* If your application details change, submit the "Notification of Change in Application Details" by the deadline  
* Filing a tax return invalidates the One-Stop Special Exception application


### Timeline for the One-Stop Special Exception System

![Timeline: donations made between 1/1 and 12/31; application must arrive by January 10th the following year; deduction from residential tax occurs from June to May of the subsequent year](./img/img_03.png)

The application deadline for the One-Stop Special Exception System is January 10 of the following year after the donation was made.  
For donations made between January 1 and December 31 of the current year, prepare an application form and required documents for each donation and send them to the municipality by the deadline.  
If you miss the deadline, you must file a tax return to claim the deduction.

Eligible Taxes and Deduction Amounts
* Tax deductions vary by method. A tax return allows deductions from both income and residential taxes, whereas the One-Stop Special Exception System only applies to residential tax.
* For deductions near the maximum limit, both methods yield nearly identical results in deduction amounts.
