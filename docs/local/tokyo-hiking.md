## Moderate hikes for enthusiasts


### Mount Mitake: Enthusiast

* A real nature-lover's delight, Mt. Mitake is filled with all the flora and fauna you could ask for, and is the gate to the Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park.
* 4 min Cable Car up the mountain
* There is a cable car, but if you decide to hike, it is about a 60-minute walk from the valley to Mitake Shrine, and then you can walk for another hour or so to reach the beautiful "Rock Garden" - a forest valley with a stream, moss-carpeted rocks, and waterfalls.

From there, it is another hour or so to the summit of Mt. Otake, with various hiking trails to other viewpoints and mountains. There is a visitor center between the ropeway and the shrine, with maps for the different trails, but note that it is closed on Mondays.
Nearest station: JR Mitake. From there, you can take a bus to Takimoto cable car station (10 minutes, 270 yen), then the cable car (6 minutes, 570 yen one way) about halfway up the mountain.

## Challenging hikes for the experienced


### Mount Kawanori

* A step up in the hiking stakes introduces Mt. Kawanori, which can be climbed year-round-but be prepared for snow in the winter.
* The hike has some risky bits, so you need to watch your footwork. The first rest station can be reached after about 35 minutes. After a rather precarious path that rises above the river, you arrive at the towering Hyakuhiro Waterfall. From here, it is an unyielding 100-minute climb to the summit, which makes an excellent spot to roll out the picnic mat and bask in the natural surroundings. On this ascent there are some ropes added for support, and a fork in the road allows you to choose a tougher trail (straight ahead) or a better-maintained trail (to your left) on your way to the summit.
* Nearest station: JR Okutama
  * From there, it is a 15-minute bus ride to the Kawanori-bashi bus stop, where the trail starts.
