## Drying clothes in Japan

There are a few common options for drying clothes in Japan:
* Hang clothes outside on a balcony using a drying rack (most common method) ☀️
* Washer-dryer combo machines
  * Space-saving but weaker drying performance compared to standalone dryers.
  * Allows for washing and drying done without moving clothes.
* Standalone clothes dryers
  * Takes up more space but provides better drying performance.
* Dehumidifiers for the room
  * Multi-purpose device and can dry the room as well as clothes hung nearby.
  * Longer drying times and louder compared to dedicated clothes dryers.
* Coin laundromats with large dryers
  * Useful for bulky items like bedding or large loads of laundry.
  * Convenient but involves travel and cost per use.
* Modern bathrooms with built-in drying functions
  * Newer apartments may have the drying feature in the bathroom (with bathtubs) which uses warm air circulation to dry clothes hung on a rod and the bathroom itself.
  * Similar to a dehumidifier but built into the bathroom setup.
